# Software-Defect-Prediction

One of the most important problem in software engineering is to evaluate the probability that a software has defects and so indirectly evaluate its reliability. Predicting software defects is a difficult tasks, because there are many variables to be considered (including the human factor).

The provided labelled dataset contains a list of 21 features that can be used to predict software defects, for instance different measures of complexity of the software. Each row in the dataset is a different software. The output column is binary (0 no-defect, 1 defect).
